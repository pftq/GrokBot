# GrokBot
It's alive! Grok living on your computer with control of the mouse/keyboard.

This Windows script will let Grok 4 run perpetually with or without your input, controlling the mouse and keyboard. You can ask it to do pretty much anything, and it'll at least try (but it is able to one-shot opening programs, typing into fields, doing system commands, etc). This requires having an API key for Grok, which you can get at https://x.ai/api

The limitation right now is that Grok 4 is the only version of Grok on the API that accepts images (for having eyes to see what's on your desktop), but it's extremely slow, taking up to 2 minutes sometimes to get a response/action.

# Instructions
1. Get an API key from https://x.ai/api
2. Save the API key to apikey.txt
3. Right-click GrokBot.exe - have fun!

There are settings available to configure in settings.ini but in general, the default is sufficient.

Bonus: You can use a ChatGPT API key as well and it'll automatically use ChatGPT, but ChatGPT is nowhere near as capable, struggling even just to click the Start menu.
